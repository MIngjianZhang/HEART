Name:
HEART: Hand simulation with EMG on HoloLens to help stroke rehabilitation

Abstract:
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. The symptoms of stroke often reflected in partial paralysis,
balance disorder and speech difficulty. Researches suggest that a successful recovery of the affected limb usually involves with 
multiple exercise on a daily basis based on the medical concept of neuroplasticity. To motivate patients to perform more exercises, 
promising studies have done in rehabilitation games.Some researchers chose immersive Virtual Reality as the display for their game 
development and others chose non-immersive flat screen. With the release of Microsoft HoloLens in 2016, Mixed Reality is proven to be 
another option for researchers to consider in stroke rehabilitation field. In this study, we are using different machine learning algorithm
to generate the pattern of transforming sEMG signal to smooth hand movement.
